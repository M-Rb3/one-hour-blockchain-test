# One-Hour Full-Stack Blockchain Test (Template)

## What You Build

An Ethereum VotingDAO smart contract that allows users to create proposals, vote on them, and determine winners, complete with comprehensive tests and optional frontend interface.

## Timebox: ~60 Minutes

- **50 minutes**: Core contract + frontend (required)
- **10 minutes**: Polish optional + tests (if time permits)

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/M-Rb3/code-assessment
cd code-assessment
npm install

# Run tests (your main focus)
npm test

# Optional: Start frontend development server
npm run dev
```

## Your Mission: Complete the TODOs

You have a **working template** with strategic TODOs. **DO NOT start from scratch** - just complete the marked sections.

#### Smart Contract (`contracts/VotingDAO.sol`)

- **TODO-1**: Implement proposal creation logic

  - Add a new Proposal to the proposals array
  - Initialize voteCount to 0 and active to true

  - Validate that the proposal is active
  - Validate that the voter hasn't already voted on this proposal
  - Mark the voter as having voted
  - Increment the vote count for the proposal
  - Emit Voted event

- **TODO-3**: Implement proposal ending logic

  - Validate that proposalId is valid
  - Validate that the proposal is currently active
  - Mark the proposal as inactive (set active to false)

- **TODO-4**: Implement winning proposal logic
